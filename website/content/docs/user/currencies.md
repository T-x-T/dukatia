description: 'What are currencies'

Dukatia deals with money and money without a currency just doesn't make sense. Per default there are two currencies: Euros and Us Dollars. An admin can edit or add more currencies. This would obviously be helpful if you live in a country that doesn't use either of those two currencies.  
You could also add your favorite crypto currency.  
Currencies are made up of a name and symbol. There is also the `minor_in_major`. This just describes the relationship between the minor and major part of a currency. For exmaple with Euros you have 100 Cents in every Euro, so the `minor_in_major` is 100. This is true for _most_ currencies, but not all!
