Budgets allow you to set spending goals. You can set a total amount you want to spend in a period. If you enable rollover, then unused budget from the previous period will be carried over.  
Matching transactions to a budget happens through tags.  
You can see the transactions from the current period that match the budget in the `Transactions in current Period` table when you have a budget opened.
