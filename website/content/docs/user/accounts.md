Accounts help you to associate transactions with a specific bank account. I also created one for cash. You should always match transactions to their actual bank account. This will help you make sure that you added all transactions correctly. If the account balance calculated by Dukatia matches what your bank tells you, you know you did everything right!  
Every account has one associated currency. All transactions will be created with the currency of their account.
