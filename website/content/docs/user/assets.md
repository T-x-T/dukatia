Assets are used to keep track of _things_. You could use it to keep track of the stocks you own, for example. I also added my car to be able to assosiate costs with it.  
You cannot manually set an amount or value per unit. You can only record these values at a specific timestamp. There are two forms that let you do this. The `Buy/Sell with transaction` form automatically records a [transaction](user/transaction). The additional cost is for recording costs or fees assosiated with the transaction that don't factor into the value of the asset. You can override the `Total` if you need to as well.
Alternatively you can use the `Update without transaction` form. I like to use it when updating share prices.
