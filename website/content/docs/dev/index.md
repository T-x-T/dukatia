## Developer Documentation

The developer documentation is currently focused on the rest API. All the routes are documented in the rest_api subdirectory.  
There are some extra notes about the [types](dev/types) used in the rest API documentation.  
I also explain a bit about how [currencies are handled](dev/currency).
