The documentation provided here is still very new and probably contains some errors. If you find anything that is wrong or unclear, then please do not hesitate to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/T-x-T/dukatia/issues). Thank you for helping me with improving the documentation!

## Installation
It is recommended to install dukatia using [docker-compose](docs/installation-docker).  
If you are using Unraid, then you can manually add the neccessary docker containers. The process is described [here](docs/installation-unraid).  
To set up a development environment refer to the [developer documentation](docs/dev)

## First time Setup
After you successfully installed dukatia, you can go ahead and add your data!
